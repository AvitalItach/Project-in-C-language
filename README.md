# Project-in-C-language
In this program we construct assembler from an imaginary assembly language.
We receive files and encode them into zeros and ones, then we transfer the zeros and ones to dots and slashes. The computer will be able to read the points and slashes and perform the necessary actions.
We implement the program in the C language, in the Ubuntu interface.
